\begin{example}{}{}
  Show that $ a \equiv b \pmod{n}$ if and only if $n$ divides $a - b$.
  \begin{proof}
    \[ r  = a \pmod{n} \implies a = aq + r, \quad q \in \mathbb{Z} \] 
    \[ a \pmod{n}  = b \pmod{n} = x \]
    \[ b  = nq_1 + x, a = nq_2 + x \]
    \[ \frac{b-a}{n}  = \frac{nq_1 + x - (nq_2 + x)}{n} = q_1 - q_2 \]
    \[ \boxed{ q_1, q_2  \in \mathbb{Z} \implies \frac{b-a}{n} \in \mathbb{Z} } \]
  \end{proof}
\end{example}

\subsection{Symmetric Cryptography}
A symmetric cyryptosystem $\Pi$ consist of three algorithms:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Decryption
  \item Encryption
  \item Generation
\end{itemize}
\begin{definition}{IND-secure}{ind-secure}
  A system $\Pi$ can be defined \textbf{IND-secure} if, given two plaintext as inputs $(P_0, P_1)$ to $\Pi$ and by randomly choosing one of them, there is no better chance of $0.5$ to determine whether the ciphertext was generated from $P_0$ or $P_1$.
\end{definition}



\section{Openssl}
Openssl has two versions 1.x and 3.x and 1.x will be dropped soon, but many applications still use it. The low level software implementations of the algorithm was a big mess, so a layer was created on top of it called \emph{EVP Crypto API}, that just takes in the parameters and does a translation handling all the data.



Typical use of openssl:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item include libraries
  \item load facilities: load the functions required
  \item create the context: select the tools, like a certain symmetric algorithm
  \item initialize the context: assign IV, nonce, key...
  \item operate on the context: provide the data on which the machine will work
  \item finalize on the context: perform the concluding operations on the last output, like putting the padding, or the length of the digest
  \item free the context: all the objects are \emph{one time objects}, at the end of the operations the objects need to be freed;
  \item free facilities
\end{enumerate}
Usually the mode of use of the libraries is the incremental mode, which allow get small blocks a data encrypted.

To get an object the library is called which will return the function pointer to the implementation.

EVP_CHIPER *c = EVP_bf_cbc();
