\section{Introduction}
Definitions:
\begin{definition}{Multi Person Multi Version}{multi-person-multi-version}
    People coordinating in long period of time.
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}{Software}{software}
    Is a collection of code and not only digital assets like: rules, documentations, procedures and many more. 
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}{Software Types}{software-types}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Stand alone}: products used alone, like email, office, calendar;
        \item \textbf{Embedded in software products}: car, smart house;
        \item \textbf{Embedded in business process}: an information system;
        \item \textbf{Embedded in production process}: embedded in factories and classic production pipelines;
    \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\subsection{Describe Software}
To describe a software we define his properties, they are divided in \textbf{functionality}, which express an action to be performed, and \textbf{non-functional}, this property describe how a functional property should behave, defining his correctness, and define his reliability, the idea is that corectness it's impossible to obtain, so it tries to limit the number of defect, setting a line that allows the threshold for the number of defects, on the other hand the availability is the percentage, over a period of time, of the system without occurring in any defect. Other non-functoinal properties are security, safety and deniability. Efficiency is the response time and the amount of resources used.

Every software has process: development, operation, maintanence. During development there are 4 main phases:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{requirements};
    \item \textbf{design};
    \item \textbf{coding};
    \item \textbf{testing};
\end{itemize}

Basic rules:
\begin{itemize}
    \item keep it simple;
    \item separation of concerns;
    \item abstraction
\end{itemize}
